Create a unity project that generates balls randomly around a scene. The user must collect the
balls and bring each of them to a 'collection' point. Keep track of how many balls have been
collected. All code should be in C#.

Break down and estimate necessary tasks to complete.

Submit a copy of the project and the built output.
